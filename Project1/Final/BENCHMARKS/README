In this folder you will find benchmark tests for the programs used in the project.

The gensolutionx.dat files result from running the GeneralAlgorithm.f90 program with a max power of 3.
The x in the file names correlates to the power (10^x) of the matrix dimension (1=10, 2=100, etc).

The tailorsolutionx.dat files result from running the SpecificAlgorithm.f90 program with a max power of 3.
The x in the file names correlates to the power (10^x) of the matrix dimension (1=10, 2=100, etc).

The LU.dat file results from running the LUDecomposition.f90 program with a 10x10 matrix.
