This Folder contains the 3 codes used in this project:

GeneralAlgorithm.f90 which solves the matrix equation using a general tridiagonal solver.
This creates output files gensolutionx.dat where x is the power (10^x) of the matrix size.
It also prints the relative error for each power, and therefore stepsize, to the screen.
To run, compile the file and run without inputs.  The program will prompt the user for a
maximum power of the matrix size (x), and then loop through all values from 1 to x.

SpecificAlgorithm.f90 which solves the matrix equation using a general tridiagonal solver.
This creates output files tailorsolutionx.dat where x is the power (10^x) of the matrix size.
It also prints the relative error for each power, and therefore stepsize, to the screen.
To run, compile the file and run without inputs.  The program will prompt the user for a
maximum power of the matrix size (x), and then loop through all values from 1 to x.

Note that for both of these solutions, the printed error may be stored in fort,6 for large x.

LUDecomposition.f90 which solves the matrix equation using LU decomposition.  The program
runs for a matrix of given dimension (N).  This paramter can be adjusted mannually in the
initial variable declaration.
