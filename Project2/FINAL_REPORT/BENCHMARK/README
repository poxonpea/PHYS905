This folder contains benchmark output files for the Jacobi.dat program.

Eigenvalue_1e.dat:  This file contains all of the eigenvalues produced by running Jacobi.dat for one electron with rho_max=6 and N=200. These
options are choen by the user at run time.

wf_1e.dat:  This file contains the wave function for the lowest lying state for the case of one electron with rho_max=6 and N=200.  These options are chosen by the user at run time.

____________

wf01.dat:  This file contains the wave function for the lowest lying state for the case of two electrons with rho_max=10, N=350, and 
omega=0.01.  These options are chosen by the user at run time.

wf5.dat:  This file contains the wave function for the lowest lying state for the case of two electrons with rho_max=10, N=350, and 
omega=5.0.  These options are chosen by the user at run time.
