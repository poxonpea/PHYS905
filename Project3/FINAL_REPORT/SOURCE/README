This directory contains all of the source code for this project.  In this main folder you will find the the non-object
oriented codes for the Euler and Velocity Verlet algorithms.  For these and all the other codes, step size and final time
can be adjusted by changing the parameters inside the code in the variable declaration section.

The ObjectOriented directory contains the codes of the EarthSun, EarthSunJupiter, and SolarSystem systems, each in their
own director.  Each folder contains a file with the appropriate solver module and an accompanying main program.
Both must be compiled together for the calculation to run.  The EarthSun codes should be compiled in gfortran (I changed
compilers halfway through) while the rest are compiled using ifort. Each of these programs produce a output file with the
position evolution of whichever planets are involved.  The EarthSun case also creates an outout file with the energy and momentum.
