This project only utilized one code, Ising.for

Ising.for computes average energy, magnetization, heat capacity, and susceptibility in the 2D ising model.
Calculations can be run over a range of temperatures and lattice sizes.
The results given here run with the following inputs, prompted by the command line:

- Size of an N by N the lattice (N) - N=20
- Beginning temperature - T=1
- Ending temperature - T=3
- Number of temperature steps.  The code will increment in (Tf-Ti)/(Number of steps) - Num=10
- Number of Monte Carlo cycles for each Temp -  MSC=100000
- Beginning orientation, random or alligned - Ordered (1)

After the run, all results will appear in the MonteCarloResults.txt file in the following order:

Temp, #Monte Carlo Cycles, Average E, Heat Capacity, Average Mag, Susceptibility, Abs. Mag


The code was compiled with the gfortran compiler.
