This project only utilized one code, Ising.for

Ising.for computes average energy, magnetization, heat capacity, and susceptibility in the 2D ising model.
Calculations can be run over a range of temperatures and lattice sizes.  To run, compile in gfortran.
The command line will prompt you to enter the following values:

- Size of an N by N the lattice (N)
- Beginning temperature
- Ending temperature
- Number of temperature steps.  The code will increment in (Tf-Ti)/(Number of steps)

After the run, all results will appear in the MonteCarloResults.txt file in the following order:

Temp, #Monte Carlo Cycles, Average E, Heat Capacity, Average Mag, Susceptibility, Abs. Mag


The code can be easily modified to print the number of accepted configuration by modifying the output statement.
Additionally, one can track values as a function of MCS by moving the call to the output function inside the
MCS loop.  Both of these modifications were done throughout the course of the project but are ommitted here.
